<h1>Alternative Gaming Bio</h1>

<p>We don&rsquo;t want to be too moralistic but we like to promote the value of good sportsmanship and generally&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;being a dickhead.</p>
<p>Akin to&nbsp;<a title="Day[9]TV: Manifesto" href="http://day9.tv/manifesto/">what Day[9] once wrote</a>: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a broad community, intelligent, curious, ambitious, and competitive. We are gamers, and we&rsquo;re pretty intolerant of bullsh*t.</p>
<p>Play keeps us curious, imaginative, and teaches us to learn from our mistakes and improve ourselves. Play develops bonds and has created many lasting friendships and communities.&rdquo;</p>
